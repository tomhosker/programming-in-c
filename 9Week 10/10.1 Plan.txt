# Write an "add_step" function which will add a board to our graph of boards.
# Write a "search_tree" function which will search through all of our tree of boards.
# Revise the "add_step" function, so that, on attempting to add a board already on the tree, it will do nothing.

# Use the triplet of "is_movable" functions on every tile of the initial board in order to find all possible initial moves.
# Add the resulting boards to our tree, with each board having its "previous" component pointing to the initial board.
# Repeat this process of adding to our tree on each new "Step" thus produced.
# Write a "make_tree" function which keeps adding "Step"s until all possible moves have been exhausted.

# Write a "search_boards_in_tree" function which searches our tree for a board where a particular tile is occupied.
# Write a "print_moves" function which takes the board found by "search_boards_in_tree" and prints out all previous boards up to the initial board.
